Some design thoughts:
1. As a user is created for main application, the protocol will be to create equivalent accounts for Rating feature. A passenger and driver account will be created. This is why PUT request is not needed for rating feature

ToDo:
1. Enable way to create composite key for current user and user that rating is for. This will identify a unique user-forUserRating key
